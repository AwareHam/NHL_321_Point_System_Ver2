321 NHL Point System

The purpose of the 3-2-1 point system is reward teams that can win a game in regulation. The idea behind the new system is to incentivise teams to not play shut down defense near the end of the game, but to intensify the game by rewarding the team with an extra point.

Brief overview of what the 3-2-1 point system is:

 3 points -> Regulation win

 2 points -> Overtime/Shootout win

 1 point -> Overtime/Shootout loss
